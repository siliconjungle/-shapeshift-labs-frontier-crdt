# Frontier CRDT

Native CRDT documents, update tooling, awareness, branches, conflict introspection, and undo for Frontier.

This package sits above [`@shapeshift-labs/frontier`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shapeshift-labs/frontier), [`@shapeshift-labs/frontier-codec`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shapeshift-labs/frontier-codec), [`@shapeshift-labs/frontier-engine`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shapeshift-labs/frontier-engine), and [`@shapeshift-labs/frontier-state`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shapeshift-labs/frontier-state). It keeps collaborative document state separate from the small JSON diff/apply core package and from the higher sync/repo/storage package.

## Install

```sh
npm install @shapeshift-labs/frontier @shapeshift-labs/frontier-codec @shapeshift-labs/frontier-engine @shapeshift-labs/frontier-state @shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt
```

## Usage

```ts
import { createCrdtDocument } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt';
import { inspectCrdtUpdate } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt/update';

const alice = createCrdtDocument({ actorId: 'alice' });
alice.set('/title', 'Draft');
alice.text('/body').insert(0, 'Hello');

const update = alice.exportUpdate();
console.log(inspectCrdtUpdate(update).ranges);

const bob = createCrdtDocument({ actorId: 'bob' });
bob.applyUpdate(update);

console.log(bob.toJSON());
```

## Rich Text

Frontier rich text is backed by the CRDT text container plus replicated mark/embed/block sidecars. Inline marks now use stable text selections, so formatting ranges move with CRDT text edits instead of staying as plain numeric offsets.

For local editor Delta transforms, range formatting, embed handling, and cursor/selection mapping outside the CRDT document itself, use [`@shapeshift-labs/frontier-richtext`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shapeshift-labs/frontier-richtext).

The package boundary is:

| Layer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `@shapeshift-labs/frontier-richtext` | Local editor transform helpers: normalize/apply Deltas, map local cursors/selections, and prepare editor intent before it becomes collaborative state. |
| `@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt` | Durable collaborative state: CRDT text, stable mark anchors, replicated mark/embed/block sidecars, update merge, conflict/version APIs, and Delta import/export at document boundaries. |
| `@shapeshift-labs/frontier-react` or an editor package | Framework/editor bindings: React subscriptions, CodeMirror/Monaco/textarea decorations, remote selections, presence rendering, and app-specific editor UI. |

In practice, editor code can use `frontier-richtext` to shape a local Delta, then commit the resulting intent to `doc.richText(path)`. Remote updates should be applied through `frontier-crdt`; the rich-text handle resolves stable anchors and exports the current editor-facing Delta with `toDelta()`.

The mark model follows the practical Peritext/Loro direction:

- Marks are stored as CRDT data with stable range anchors.
- Marks support explicit boundary expansion: `after`, `before`, `none`, or `both`.
- Bold/italic-style marks default to `after`; link/comment-style marks default to `none`.
- `toDelta()` exports a Quill Delta-shaped view for editor bindings.
- Same-key overlaps are resolved deterministically; non-conflicting keys compose.

```ts
const doc = createCrdtDocument({ actorId: 'writer-a' });
const rich = doc.richText('/article/body');

rich.fromDelta([{ insert: 'hello world' }]);
rich.format(0, 5, { bold: true }, { expand: 'after' });
rich.format(6, 5, { link: 'https://frontier.dev' }, { expand: 'none' });

console.log(rich.toDelta());
```

This implementation is informed by [Peritext](https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext/) and [Loro rich text](https://www.loro.dev/blog/loro-richtext): boundary expansion is explicit, mark ranges are anchored to the CRDT text sequence, and Delta export is the editor-facing representation. Frontier does not yet expose a full editor schema, ProseMirror/Quill binding package, or multi-value comment rendering policy; those belong above this package.

## API

```ts
import {
  createCrdtDocument,
  createCrdtDocumentFromSnapshot
} from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt';

import {
  decodeCrdtUpdate,
  diffCrdtUpdate,
  encodeCrdtUpdate,
  inspectCrdtUpdate,
  mergeCrdtUpdates
} from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt/update';
import { createCrdtBranch } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt/branch';
import { createCrdtUndoManager } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt/undo';
```

## Subpath Imports

```ts
import { mergeCrdtUpdates } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt/update';
import { createCrdtDocument } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt/document';
import { createCrdtStateEngine } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt/state';
import { createCrdtAwareness } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt/awareness';
import { createCrdtBranch } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt/branch';
import { createCrdtUndoManager } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt/undo';
```

## Version Frames

Use version frames when an operation was authored against a specific document view and must be validated later before replay, optimistic commit, branch merge policy, undo, or rich-text anchor handling.

```ts
const doc = createCrdtDocument({ actorId: 'editor-a' });
doc.set('/title', 'Draft');
doc.markVersion('authored');

const frame = doc.captureFrame({
  mark: 'authored',
  paths: ['/title']
});

doc.set('/sidebar/open', true);

const evaluation = doc.evaluateFrame(frame);
console.log(evaluation.ok, evaluation.relation, evaluation.conflictingPaths);
```

Frames store the causal version (`heads` plus `stateVector`) and optional bounded path snapshots. Plain version evaluation requires the document to be exactly at the authored version; path evaluation tolerates unrelated later CRDT operations and reports the changed/conflicting paths when watched state moved. Pass `includeValues: false` for overlap-only validation when a caller already owns value checks.

## Patch-Native Views

Every local commit and remote `applyUpdate()` returns a `CrdtCommitResult` with:

- `update`: the encoded native CRDT update for storage or peers.
- `viewPatch`: a compact Frontier patch from the previous materialized JSON view to the convergent current view.
- `heads` and `stateVector`: the causal frontier after the commit.

The state subpath can route those same patches to app adapters without re-diffing the document:

```ts
import { createCrdtStateEngine } from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt/state';

const doc = createCrdtStateEngine({
  actorId: 'ui-a',
  patchSinks: [
    ({ source, patch, result }) => {
      // Feed state-cache invalidation, React external stores, logging, or undo observers.
      console.log(source, patch.length, result.heads.length);
    }
  ]
});

doc.watch('/tasks/*', ['done'], (patch) => {
  // Routed subset for UI subscriptions.
});

const result = doc.set('/tasks/0/done', true);
console.log(result.viewPatch);
```

`onPatch()` adds a global sink after construction. Sinks receive only non-empty patches, after the embedded state engine has applied the patch, and the event keeps the original lazy commit result so reading `result.update` is still opt-in.

## Lattice Merge Laws

The `./lattice` subpath exposes state-based CRDT helpers for package tests and schema-level prototypes that need merge to be a join over a partial order:

```ts
import {
  assertCrdtJoinLaws,
  createCrdtScopedServerDiff,
  createCrdtOrSetLattice,
  addCrdtOrSetValue,
  removeCrdtOrSetValue
} from '@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt/lattice';

const set = createCrdtOrSetLattice();
const added = addCrdtOrSetValue(set.bottom(), 'task-1', 'alice:1');
const removed = removeCrdtOrSetValue(added, 'task-1');

assertCrdtJoinLaws(set, [added, removed]);
```

The built-in palette covers G-counters, PN-counters, observed-remove sets, observed-remove maps, and multi-value registers. `assertCrdtJoinLaws()` checks idempotence, commutativity, associativity, inflation, bottom, and sampled least-upper-bound behavior so max-only scalar merges or non-idempotent merge functions fail before becoming sync behavior.

`createCrdtScopedServerDiff()` implements a state-based CRDT push response pattern: merge the submitted client delta into the server state, scope the response to the keys or elements touched by that delta, and send only the server-side lattice information the client did not submit. Clients still call the same `join()` on the response; they do not need a separate protocol branch for scoped responses.

## Tombstone Compaction Plans

Use `planCompaction()` when storage or sync policy has a durable retention frontier and wants to replace old CRDT history with a compact checkpoint:

```ts
const plan = doc.planCompaction({
  retentionStateVector: lastAckedByEveryPeer,
  retireActors: ['old-device']
});

if (plan.safe) {
  const restored = createCrdtDocumentFromSnapshot(plan.snapshot);
  console.log(restored.toJSON());
}
```

The plan is intentionally a replacement checkpoint, not a normal delta update. `safe` is true only when the checkpoint preserves the materialized JSON view and `retentionStateVector` covers every source actor. Missing or lagging retention returns `reason: 'missing-retention'` or `reason: 'retention-behind'`, so callers do not accidentally garbage-collect tombstones that a lagging peer still needs. A safe plan reports compacted heads/state vector, retired-actor coverage, pruned operation counts, and before/after update bytes for storage policy decisions.

## Package Scope

This package is intentionally limited to:

- Native CRDT document creation and document handles.
- CRDT JSON, map, list, plain text, counter, binary, tree, XML, and rich-text document operations.
- CRDT update encode/decode/merge/diff/inspect/filter/obfuscate helpers.
- State-based lattice helpers and join-law assertions for CRDT field prototypes.
- Durable versioning, bounded version frames, compaction checkpoints, snapshots, checkout/fork helpers, branch wrappers, conflict introspection, awareness, and undo.

It does not expose sync providers, repos, storage adapters, document URLs, local sync networks, model-checking transports, WebSocket transports, or editor text bindings. Those belong in the higher `@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt-sync` and `@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt-websocket` packages.

## Stability

The stable package surface is the plain document/update layer:

- `createCrdtDocument`, map/list/plain-text/counter/binary JSON operations, materialized view patches, state vectors, version frames, compaction plans, snapshots, checkout/fork/viewAt, changes-since exports, history traversal, commit metadata, and conflict introspection.
- Update tooling in `@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt/update`: encode/decode, inspect, merge, diff, filter, compact, obfuscate, update metadata, actor ranges, and state-vector conversion.
- Awareness and branch wrappers as package-level contracts above the document API.
- Rich-text marks with anchored ranges, explicit boundary expansion, deterministic same-key ordering, and Delta export are usable for editor prototypes and higher-layer bindings.
- Lattice helpers in `@shapeshift-labs/frontier-crdt/lattice` are a quality-gate and prototype surface for state-based field CRDTs; they are not used by the document runtime hot path.

The experimental surface is intentionally marked as such:

- Rich-text embeds, blocks, multi-value comment/link rendering policy, and XML/tree convenience helpers are early CRDT surfaces. Use them for prototypes, but plain text, JSON containers, and anchored inline marks are the hardened path.
- Undo refuses to replay when the document has advanced at overlapping paths. It is safe against known destructive replay cases, but selective CRDT undo is still evolving.
- Internal update byte layouts, packed actor/sequence storage, native text pieces, and compact update frames are optimization details. Do not treat encoded updates as cross-version durable storage unless a future release explicitly documents a compatibility window.

## TypeScript

The package ships ESM JavaScript plus `.d.ts` declarations for the root export and public subpaths. The package-local TypeScript source lives in `src/` and compiles directly to `dist/`.

## Validation

```sh
npm test
npm run fuzz
npm run bench
npm run pack:dry
```

The hardening suite covers concurrent map/list/text operations, list moves, same-key conflict introspection/resolution, undo refusal and non-overlapping replay, rich-text sidecars, branch/viewAt/metadata behavior, duplicate and partial update delivery, filtered updates, malformed update inputs, and randomized multi-peer convergence.

Local `change()` transactions expose creates to later operations in the same transaction. Register deletes remain CRDT tombstone operations, and transaction-local list/tree/text helpers replay pending operations before planning later moves, deletes, or reads.
